# About

This project demonstrates how to get a folder and file count recursively for a folder name passed. If the user lacks proper permissions an exception is caught and thrown.

This can be used as is or modified with conditions to get specific file types. 

Example code can be found in the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/enumeration-globbing-folders-files) where one option is using [file globbing](http://example.com). There are plenty of variations to select from.
